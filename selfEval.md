# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators? 
* I'm feeling really good about these! I like these types of logic equations anyway, so it's almost fun to use them in a new context.
2. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
* Same as above, I feel fairly confident. I do think that I need to build some muscle memory to make all of this faster, but I think my understanding is solid. 
3. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
* Same as above. This was decidely less difficult than yesterday's GitHub exercise.
4. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
* Approximately 1.5 hours, which is a little more than I expected-- I'd estimated an hour. I'm certain I'll become more efficient with practice. 
5. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
* I want to build in some unstructured practice time to continue building confidence in all of these skills, but that might need to happen outside the scope of Mod0. I'd love to block off some time for myself next week to work on that. 
6. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
* Right now I'm just curious and excited to get to higher level applications of all of these skills/see them all in a more natural context. I'll definitely continue reaching out to my peers to see if we can figure things out by combining brains. I also have a handful of people around me with experience both with Turing directly and with software more generally, so I can also tap those connections if I'm in a bind.
